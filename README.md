### 👋 Hi, I’m @MrFox-hub

- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, full-stack development, webpage building, and always finding ways to improve and optimize code for smoother and faster experiences.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GoLang, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything tech-related — open to projects big or small, especially if you're even remotely interested!
- 📫 How to reach me: rebanemartti@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm currently studying at [kood/Jõhvi](https://www.kood.tech/) — an innovative coding school with a project-based learning model.

🎯 I'm especially drawn to frontend development, but I enjoy working across the stack. I’m also planning to explore Rust, VUE and currently deepening my skills in database engineering and cybersecurity.
